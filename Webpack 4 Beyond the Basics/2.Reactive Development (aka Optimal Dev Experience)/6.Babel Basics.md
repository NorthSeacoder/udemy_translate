Welcome back in the last episode we added loaders to our development workflow.  
欢迎回来，上一节中我们在开发工作流中添加了 loaders

You can start where we left off or to catch up.  
你可以从我们离开的地方开始，或者赶上进度。

Check out the branch babel one.  
检出 babel one 分支

All right so life is getting pretty happy for our developer experience.  
我们的编程经历越发令人开心

So far we've only used part of the real power of javascript.  
我们马上就能使用 JavaScript 的真正力量

We've been limited by the features of javascript our current browser can run when you're developing in Chrome.
当我们用 chrome 浏览器开发时，我们受到当前浏览器能支持的 JavaScript 功能的限制

Everything looks peachy but shipped the same stuff to Internet Explorer or Android.  
所有的东西看起来都很漂亮，但都是通过 ie 或 Android 发布的。

We started seeing syntax errors. old browsers don't know ES6 the latest version of javascript but we still want to use it.
我们会遇到语法错误，旧版本浏览器不支持 ES6（最新版的 JavaScript），但我们仍然想要使用它

Enter transpires to turn shiny new syntax into total usable old syntax babel is an integral part of webpack's power.
用于将新语法转换为旧语法---babel 是 webpack 不可或缺的一部分

But let's get it set up in our project before I talk about it too much.
我们先将 babel 安装进我们的项目

First things first in our terminal let's install babel-core
首先在终端中安装 babel-core

next Let's create a .babelrc file  
接下来创建一个.babelrc 文件

this Bebel or see file as a hidden file.  
这是一个隐藏文件

Technically it all reside in the root of our project it will contain the rules that babel will live by what features of javascript do we want to use with this project.
一般来说，我们把它放在项目的根目录，它会用 Babel 的规则包含我们需要在项目中使用的 JavaScript 功能

What is strange and interesting question.

The babbel Web site will be crucial to look up tools you may need.

The community is large and prolific.

Having covered all of javascript's various specifications they went on to write transpiring plugins

for various flavors and new languages all compiling to any other flavor of Javascript.

So for example let's say we want to use those nifty aero functions in E6 and Manges.

Add the following

babbel provides a plugin for Aero functions.

Let's install that and add the plug into our babbel RC and our terminal.

NPM install Babbo plug in Transform.

Yes 20:15

aero functions as well as the babbel sealife

Babel or C is adjacent file

contains plugins and this will take an array of plug ins.

We only have one for right now.

Transform is 2015.

Aero functions.

Now let's test it out in the terminal type babbel and then source main G-S you can see that is 6 arrow

function was converted to any S-5 function.

So that's from the command line where we can use this by adding it as a loader

at the top.

Let's add a loader for javascript will do test J.S.

and we'll use

the Babel loader.

Finally we want to tell it to exclude everything in node modules.

So now it's only going to transpire that our project code will want to install the babbel loader.

All right let's give it a shot.

Looks good if you got lost at any point this branch holds the Finnish working code.

Now what if we wanted to use something like 6 style imports that would produce additional code as it

creates a poly file for browsers that don't support E6.

We'll get more into Babble's Pawley full powers in the next episode.

See there.
