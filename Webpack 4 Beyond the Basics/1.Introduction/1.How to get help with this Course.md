It before we dive into the course I wanted to tell you the best places to get help with Web back.

I'm definitely available for questions.

You can e-mail me at law at Sinema set free dot com or find me on Twitter at law Watson.

I'll try and respond as best I can.

Secondly there is a web pect channel on get her which is like get Hub's version of slack.

A chat room filled with very helpful people.

Finally I found Stack Overflow extremely useful over the years.

Sometimes an error will appear that I don't understand.

So I'll copy and paste it into Google and stack overflows answers are always the highest quality.

Just look for the green check mark.

If you follow the lessons as best you can and there's just something wrong that's blocking your progress.

Please reach out to me.

I'm happy to correct anything in these lessons that is unclear or just plain wrong and always know.

You can check out the final version of every single class from the get hub repo which I'll talk about

in the next episode.

Please help me keep this course evergreen.

The technology moves fast but I want this resource to stand as something both beginners and professionals

can turn to for clear simple walkthrough as the latest techniques.

Thanks again.
